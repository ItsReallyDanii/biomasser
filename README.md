## 📄 Abstract

Transport microstructures—whether in biological xylem or electronic cooling plates—are often limited by a trade-off between **efficiency** (flow rate/heat flux) and **material cost** (density/pressure drop). Traditional topology optimization is computationally expensive, while standard biomimicry often copies evolutionary constraints (like growth and self-repair) that are irrelevant to engineering.

This project introduces a **"Bio-Audited" Generative Design Framework**. By training a surrogate-assisted autoencoder on biological data and fine-tuning it via differentiable physics solvers, we created a **"Material Compiler"** capable of inverse-designing microstructures for specific multi-physics targets.

**Data Source & Scale:**
The model was trained on macroscopic cross-sections of *Pinus taeda* (UruDendro dataset) to learn the **mesoscale density gradients** of biological wood (e.g., the transition from porous earlywood to dense latewood).
* **Why this matters:** Unlike microscopic cellular models which are often too small to manufacture, this model captures **printable structural heterogeneity**—allowing us to generate Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) that can be produced via standard SLA/FDM 3D printing.

## 📊 Key Results

### 1. The Biological Efficiency Gap
We mapped the trade-off between **Flow Rate** (Simulated via Darcy solver) and **Stiffness Potential** (Heuristic $E \propto \rho^2$).
* **Finding:** The AI identified a Pareto front of designs that are significantly stiffer than biological xylem for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity.
* **Implication:** Much of the void space in real xylem is hydraulically redundant in steady-state conditions, optimized instead for cavitation resistance and repair—constraints we can remove for synthetic engineering.

### 2. Thermal Generalization (The "Cooling Coral")
We retrained the physics engine to solve the **Steady-State Heat Diffusion Equation** ($\nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) = 0$) to design heat sinks for high-performance electronics.
* **Benchmark:** We compared AI designs against Straight Fins, Grids, and Random Noise (Foam).
* **The Win:** While Random Noise achieved high cooling flux, it suffered from massive pressure drop. The AI design occupied the optimal "High Flux / Low Resistance" quadrant.

### 3. Manufacturability & Control
Unlike generative models that produce "pixel dust," this framework enforces structural connectivity.
* **Functionally Graded Materials (FGM):** We successfully generated continuous beams transitioning from **Dense ($E_{high}$)** to **Porous ($E_{low}$)**, validated for SLA 3D printing.
* **Design Manifold:** We demonstrated control by sweeping the latent space to generate a smooth transition of morphologies.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The framework consists of three coupled modules forming a closed-loop design engine:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Geometry Generator] -->|Latent Code z| B(Decoder)
    B -->|Microstructure| C{Physics Surrogate}
    C -->|Predict Flow/Heat| D[Optimizer]
    D -->|Gradient Update| A
    B -->|Validation| E[FEM/FDM Solver]
The Eye (Autoencoder): A Convolutional Autoencoder learns the manifold of valid porous structures from biological datasets.

The Brain (Surrogate): A Differentiable CNN predicts physics properties (R

The Hand (Optimizer): Performs gradient descent in the latent space to maximize performance targets (e.g., "Maximize Heat Flux while keeping Density < 0.3").
